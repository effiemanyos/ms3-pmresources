# **UX DESIGN**  

## **Strategy Plane** 

### **Target Audience**
- Recent University/College Graduates (Tech & Non-Tech Backgrounds)
- Aspiring Product Managers (Entry/Mid-Level Professionals [Other Backgrounds])
- Product Enthusiasts (Curious & Interested Professionals)
- Young Tech Startup Owners (Digital Products, SaaS, Apps, Web Apps)
- Young Business Founders (Services, eCommerce, Agencies, Consultancy)
- Entry/Mid-Level Product Managers (Interns, Associates, PMs)
- Professionals Already Transitioning Into Product Management

### **User Persona**

According to our user/market research:
- Most of them utilize the web-based app on their desktops and/or laptops during work and/or study time.
- The vast majority of them are between 22-32 years old, which indicates they are mostly entry/mid-level.
- Most of them have at least a bachelor's degree; however, some have masters in business or related fields.
- They feel passionate about tech and innovation, they are customer-obssesed and love solving problems.
- They are mainly from English-speaking countries: Ireland, England, Scotland, United States, Australia.
- They are very interested in digital products, user experience, customer behaviour, and optimization.
- Within the tech adoption curve of Rogers, most of them are considered 'innovators' and 'early adopters'.
- The vast majority finds themselves under the constraints of a tight/no budget to spend on studies.
- They do not have time to invest in long courses or even to research what sources of info are the best.
- Their favourite brands and tools are: Apple, Notion, Miro, Figma, Canva, Trello, Jira, Asana, Amazon.

### **User Needs**

These are some crucial **user pain points and struggles** worth mentioning:

1. **Lack of Trust** <br>
Entry level professionals, our main users, do not know how to differentiate between high-quality content and poor/fake Product Management content on the internet, as they do not have previus professional experience in the field; moreover, most of our users do not have a mentor guiding them in their journey.
2. **Quantity Over Quality** <br>
There is too much information on the internet, and most sources share very vague, superficial or inaccurate information about Product Management. The spread of misleading and erroneous information can lead newbies to start their Product Management careers with the wrong foot, causing horrible disasters in the launch of new products and/or features. 
3. **Overwhelming & Exhausting** <br>
It is overwhelming and exhausting for users to navigate through all those online resources (too many options to choose from), while also trying to find the right information from the right source without having to consult friends or colleagues (assuming they know some people in the field).
4. **Lack of Time** <br>
There is too much going on in the users' lives at the moment (esp. during the global pandemic) that they do not have the time to search for the information themselves because it is proven that it takes a lot of time to do the research every time they need to know about an specific topic. 
5. **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** <br>
During the user research, most users have also shared that they constantly feel that they are missing out on great tips and valuable content from high-quality resources (esp. from Fortune 100 companies, product-related book authors, mentors, subject matter experts, experienced PMs).
6. **No Official PM Studies** <br>
At the moment, no official Product Management studies are offered by universities or colleges, and if they are  Users are looking for cost-effective bootcamps, workshops, cohorts, mentors, and online courses to learn more about this relatively new field in the tech industry.

> (^) With this business model, users will benefit from other people's free contributions (i.e. crowdsourced information - like Waze).             
> (^) When Selftod already has enough data entered by registered users/admin, we will start charging businesses to place ads.           
> (^) The app will always be free for users (restricted to guest users) as they are the ones that contribute the most to its growth.
