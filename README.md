# **UX DESIGN**  

## **Strategy Plane** 

### **Target Audience**
- Recent University/College Graduates (Tech & Non-Tech Backgrounds)
- Aspiring Product Managers (Entry/Mid-Level Professionals [Other Backgrounds])
- Product Enthusiasts (Curious & Interested Professionals)
- Young Tech Startup Owners (Digital Products, SaaS, Apps, Web Apps)
- Young Business Founders (Services, eCommerce, Agencies, Consultancy)
- Entry/Mid-Level Product Managers (Interns, Associates, PMs)
- Professionals Already Transitioning Into Product Management

### **User Persona**

According to our user/market research:
- Most of them utilize the web-based app on their desktops and/or laptops during work and/or study time.
- The vast majority of them are between 22-32 years old, which indicates they are mostly entry/mid-level.
- Most of them have at least a bachelor's degree; however, some have masters in business or related fields.
- They feel passionate about tech and innovation, they are customer-obssesed and love solving problems.
- They are mainly from English-speaking countries: Ireland, England, Scotland, United States, Australia.
- They are very interested in digital products, user experience, customer behaviour, and optimization.
- Within the tech adoption curve of Rogers, most of them are considered 'innovators' and 'early adopters'.
- The vast majority finds themselves under the constraints of a tight/no budget to spend on studies.
- They do not have time to invest in long courses or even to research what sources of info are the best.
- Their favourite brands and tools are: Apple, Notion, Miro, Figma, Canva, Trello, Jira, Asana, Amazon.

### **User Needs**

These are some crucial **user pain points and struggles** worth mentioning:

1. **Lack of Trust** <br>
Entry level professionals, our main users, do not know how to differentiate between high-quality content and poor/fake Product Management content on the internet, as they do not have previus professional experience in the field; moreover, most of our users do not have a mentor guiding them in their journey.
2. **Quantity Over Quality** <br>
There is too much information on the internet, and most sources share very vague, superficial or inaccurate information about Product Management. The spread of misleading and erroneous information can lead newbies to start their Product Management careers with the wrong foot, causing horrible disasters in the launch of new products and/or features. 
3. **Overwhelming & Exhausting** <br>
It is overwhelming and exhausting for users to navigate through all those online resources (too many options to choose from), while also trying to find the right information from the right source without having to consult friends or colleagues (assuming they know some people in the field).
4. **Lack of Time** <br>
There is too much going on in the users' lives at the moment (esp. during the global pandemic) that they do not have the time to search for the information themselves because it is proven that it takes a lot of time to do the research every time they need to know about an specific topic. 
5. **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** <br>
During the user research, most users have also shared that they constantly feel that they are missing out on great tips and valuable content from high-quality resources (esp. from Fortune 100 companies, product-related book authors, mentors, subject matter experts, experienced PMs).
6. **No Official PM Studies** <br>
At the moment, no official Product Management studies are offered by universities or colleges, and if they are  Users are looking for cost-effective bootcamps, workshops, cohorts, mentors, and online courses to learn more about this relatively new field in the tech industry.

### **User Goals**
- View product-related resources shared by like-minded professionals in Selftod community. 
- View, search, filter, discover, share, edit, delete resources created by them and others.
- Perform the actions right above from anywhere, via any type of digital device or browser.
- View featured resources on a monthly basis shared by the admin of Selftod's community.
- Learn about PM at their own pace (in their own time/schedule), customized to their needs.
- Discover new valuable sources of information about the field which are highly recommended.
- Save time by going straight to the app to look for specific information urgently needed.
- Find the right sources of information to learn PM by themselves with the required guidance.
- Be up-to-date with the latest frameworks, tools, and techniques that people are applying.

# **DEPLOYMENT**

### **Flask Application**

1. Install Flask - type in terminal: 
    ```
    pip3 install Flask
    ```
2. Now we need to create a few new files. First, our Python file that will be the foundation of our application. You can name it something else, in this case, I used app.py, so type in the terminal: 
    ```
    touch app.py
    ```
3. Next, we will be storing some sensitive data, and we need to hide them using environment variables. You can use the terminal or just create a new file. I used the terminal, so type in the terminal:
    ```
    touch env.py
    ```
4. That file should never be pushed to GitHub, so we need to be able to ignore it somehow, so type in the terminal:
    ```
   touch .gitignore
    ```
5. Double check in the gitignore file that you see "env.py" and "pycache/"
6. Go to the env.py file and add the following:
    ```
    import os
 
    os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
    os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
    os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME"
    ```
7. Go to app.py file and import the following:
    ```
    import os
    from flask import (
    Flask, flash, render_template,
    redirect, request, session, url_for)
    from flask_pymongo import PyMongo
    from bson.objectid import ObjectId
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
    if os.path.exists("env.py"):
        import env
    ```
8. Create an instance of Flask
    ```
    app = Flask(__name__)
    ```
9. To test your application, tell your app how and where to run your application. Set your IP and PORT environment variables in the hidden env.py file. Make sure to update this to debug=False before the actual deployment of your project.
    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host=os.environ.get("IP"),
    port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
    debug=True)
    ```
10. You can now run your application, type in the terminal:
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

### **Heroku**

*Workspace Terminal*.-

1. Run **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt** to collect any applications and dependencies by creating a requirements.txt file.
2. Run **echo web: python app.py > Procfile** to create the Procfile (what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it).

As you can see, these are the files that Heroku needs to run the app. 
> - First, we need to tell Heroku which apps and dependencies are required to run our web app, via **requirements.txt**,         
> - Next, the **Procfile** is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app, and how to run it, so we use the **echo command**.        
> - (^) Remember to delete the second line in Procfile because sometimes it can cause problems when running the app on Heroku.

*Heroku Website*.-

3. Go to **[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)**.
4. Log in or create a new account (select Python as your Primary Development Language).
5. You will receive a confirmation email with a magic link to activate your new account.
6. From the dashboard, click on **Create New App**.
7. Type in your app name (choose something unique - don't use spaces, use hyphens instead).
8. Select the right or at least the closest region from the options available.
9. Click on **Create App**.     
10. If you logged in instead, click on your preferred app first.
11. Navigate over to the **Deploy** tab.
12. Go to the **Deployment Method** section.
13. Click on **GitHub**.
14. In the **App Connected to GitHub** section, search for your preferred repository.
15. Click on **Connect**.
16. Go to the **Settings** tab.
17. Scroll down to **Config Vars** section.
18. Click **Reveal Config Vars**.
19. In **Config Vars** section, enter the key and value pairs as per your **env.py** file:

|Key|Value|
|----|----|
|IP|0.0.0.0|
