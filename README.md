### **User Persona**

According to our user/market research:
- Most of them utilize the web-based app on their desktops and/or laptops during work and/or study time.
- The vast majority of them are between 22-32 years old, which indicates they are mostly entry/mid-level.

- Their favourite brands and tools are: Apple, Notion, Miro, Figma, Canva, Trello, Jira, Asana, Amazon.

### **User Needs**

These are some crucial **user pain points and struggles** worth mentioning:

1. **Lack of Trust** <br>
Entry level professionals, our main users, do not know how to differentiate between high-quality content and poor/fake Product Management content on the internet, as they do not have previus professional experience in the field; moreover, most of our users do not have a mentor guiding them in their journey.

2. **Quantity Over Quality** <br>
There is too much information on the internet, and most sources share very vague, superficial or inaccurate information about Product Management. The spread of misleading and erroneous information can lead newbies to start their Product Management careers with the wrong foot, causing horrible disasters in the launch of new products and/or features. 

3. **Overwhelming & Exhausting** <br>
It is overwhelming and exhausting for users to navigate through all those online resources (too many options to choose from), while also trying to find the right information from the right source without having to consult friends or colleagues (assuming they know some people in the field).

4. **Lack of Time** <br>
There is too much going on in the users' lives at the moment (esp. during the global pandemic) that they do not have the time to search for the information themselves because it is proven that it takes a lot of time to do the research every time they need to know about an specific topic. 

5. **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** <br>
During the user research, most users have also shared that they constantly feel that they are missing out on great tips and valuable content from high-quality resources (esp. from Fortune 100 companies, product-related book authors, mentors, subject matter experts, experienced PMs).

6. **No Official PM Studies** <br>
At the moment, no official Product Management studies are offered by universities or colleges, and if they are  Users are looking for cost-effective bootcamps, workshops, cohorts, mentors, and online courses to learn more about this relatively new field in the tech industry.

### **User Goals**
- View product-related resources shared by like-minded professionals in Selftod community. 
- View, search, filter, discover, share, edit, delete resources created by them and others.
- Perform the actions right above from anywhere, via any type of digital device or browser.
- View featured resources on a monthly basis shared by the admin of Selftod's community.
- Learn about PM at their own pace (in their own time/schedule), customized to their needs.
- Discover new valuable sources of information about the field which are highly recommended.
- Save time by going straight to the app to look for specific information urgently needed.
- Find the right sources of information to learn PM by themselves with the required guidance.
- Be up-to-date with the latest frameworks, tools, and techniques that people are applying.

- Golden age of PM → Companies have realized that the most successful businesses are product-oriented.
- Tech gap in Irish market → 42% of Irish people describe themselves as being ‘below avg.' for digital skills.
- Boom in tech industry worldwide → Specially after COVID-19, most businesses were forced to go online.
- [*The Product Economy Is Increasing The Need For Product Managers by Carlos Gonzalez De Villaumbrosia*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/12/10/the-product-economy-is-increasing-the-need-for-product-managers/?sh=30654bfa6253)

> (^) With this business model, users will benefit from other people's free contributions (i.e. crowdsourced information - like Waze).             
> (^) When Selftod already has enough data entered by registered users/admin, we will start charging businesses to place ads.           
> (^) The app will always be free for users (restricted to guest users) as they are the ones that contribute the most to its growth.      

### **Business Goals**
- Be the go-to place for the target audience to learn about PM from top product-related resources.
- Create a product management community where professionals recommend the best PM resources.

## **Surface Plane** 

### **Typography**

Only one font was used for this project (for titles and paragraphs):
 
- **[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by **Indian Type Foundry** and **Jonny Pinhorn**.

**About Poppins**

"Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.

Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.

Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high."

The Devanagari is designed by **Ninad Kale**. The Latin is by **Jonny Pinhorn**.

### **Consistent Styling**

```HTML
<!-- Main Titles Styling -->

<h3 class="center-align indigo-text text-accent-3">Add Category</h3>
```

```HTML
<!-- Buttons Styling-->

<a href="#" class="btn cyan accent-4 white-text text-shadow button-styling">
    View All Resources<i class="fas fa-book-reader left"></i></a>

<button type="submit" class="btn white-text indigo accent-3 text-shadow button-styling">
    Save Category <i class="fas fa-check-circle left"></i>
</button>
```

```CSS
/* Class text-shadow */

.text-shadow {
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

```CSS
/* Class button-styling */

.button-styling {
    border-radius: 35px;
}
```

The simple styling for titles and buttons was intentionally chosen for this project because the data was the main focus. To make this possible, we used [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), a bit of CSS, and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons.

### **Color Scheme**

According to an article on **[The Science of Colour Persuasion](https://idealogicbrandlab.com/color-persuasion/)** by **IDealogic® Brand Lab**:

Color establishes **brand recognition** amongst users, therefore it is crucial that the same colors are always used across all channels, such as website, social media, advertising, product packaging, merchandising, among others.

The following are the color palette used for this project:

![web app on different devices](/static/images/color-palette.png "web app on different devices")

**Primary Colours:**
> - **Blue** → Associated with **trust, loyalty, dependability, logic, security, serenity,** and also **stimulates productivity**.
> - **White/Grey** → Associated with **innocence, purity, cleanliness, simplistic, pristine,** and also **provides a modern feel**.

### **Logo Variations**
- Logotype
- Isotype
- Imagetype

# **DEPLOYMENT**

### **MongoDB Atlas Database Creation**

1. Create an account with MongoDB
2. Log in or sign up to MongoDB
3. Create a new cluster
4. Go to the **Collections** tab
5. Click on **+ Create Database**
6. Enter **Database name**
7. Enter **Collection name**
8. Click on **Create**
9. Add all the desired collections
10. Click on **INSERT DOCUMENT**
11. Add key and value
12. Click on **Insert**

### **Flask Application**

1. Install Flask - type in terminal: 
    ```
    pip3 install Flask
    ```
2. Now we need to create a few new files. First, our Python file that will be the foundation of our application. You can name it something else, in this case, I used app.py, so type in the terminal: 
    ```
    touch app.py
    ```
3. Next, we will be storing some sensitive data, and we need to hide them using environment variables. You can use the terminal or just create a new file. I used the terminal, so type in the terminal:
    ```
    touch env.py
    ```
4. That file should never be pushed to GitHub, so we need to be able to ignore it somehow, so type in the terminal:
    ```
   touch .gitignore
    ```
5. Double check in the gitignore file that you see "env.py" and "pycache/"
6. Go to the env.py file and add the following:
    ```
    import os
 
    os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
    os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
    os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME"
    ```
7. Go to app.py file and import the following:
    ```
    import os
    from flask import (
    Flask, flash, render_template,
    redirect, request, session, url_for)
    from flask_pymongo import PyMongo
    from bson.objectid import ObjectId
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
    if os.path.exists("env.py"):
        import env
    ```
8. Create an instance of Flask
    ```
    app = Flask(__name__)
    ```
9. To test your application, tell your app how and where to run your application. Set your IP and PORT environment variables in the hidden env.py file. Make sure to update this to debug=False before the actual deployment of your project.
    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host=os.environ.get("IP"),
    port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
    debug=True)
    ```
10. You can now run your application, type in the terminal:
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

### **Flask & MongoDB**

1. To get Flask to communicate with MongoDB, we first need to install a third-party library called [Flask-PyMongo V2.3.0](https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
    ```
    pip3 install flask-pymongo
    ```

2. We would also need to install a pack called [dnspython V2.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/) to use the Mongo SRV connection string:
    ```
    pip3 install dnspython
    ```

3. It is important to remember that when you install new packages, you must update the requirements.txt, so that Heroku knows we require more to run the app:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

### **Heroku**

**Workspace Terminal**

1. Run **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt** to collect any applications and dependencies by creating a requirements.txt file
2. Run **echo web: python app.py > Procfile** to create the Procfile (what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it)

As you can see, these are the files that Heroku needs to run the app.
> - First, we need to tell Heroku which apps and dependencies are required to run our web app, via **requirements.txt**,         
> - Next, the **Procfile** is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app, and how to run it, so we use the **echo command**.        
> - Remember to delete the second line in Procfile because sometimes it can cause problems when running the app on Heroku.

**Heroku Website**

3. Go to **[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)**
4. Log in or create a new account (select Python as your Primary Development Language)
5. You will receive a confirmation email with a magic link to activate your new account
6. From the dashboard, click on **Create New App**
7. Type in your app name (choose something unique - don't use spaces, use hyphens instead)
8. Select the right or at least the closest region from the options available
9. Click on **Create App**
10. If you logged in instead, click on your preferred app first
11. Navigate over to the **Deploy** tab
12. Go to the **Deployment Method** section
13. Click on **GitHub**
14. In the **App Connected to GitHub** section, search for your preferred repository
15. Click on **Connect**
16. Go to the **Settings** tab
17. Scroll down to **Config Vars** section
18. Click **Reveal Config Vars**
19. In **Config Vars** section, enter the key and value pairs as per your **env.py** file:

|Key|Value|
|----|----|
|IP|0.0.0.0|
|PORT|5000|
|SECRET_KEY|YOUR_SECRET_KEY (*)|
|MONGO_URI|"mongodb+srv://..." (**)|
|MONGO_DBNAME|YOUR_DB_NAME|

> (*) Generate your secret key on [randomkeygen.com](https://randomkeygen.com/).           
> (**) Used to connect to your database.

20. Then, click on **Hide Config Vars**
21. Go back to the **Deploy** tab
22. Scroll down to **Automatic Deploys**
23. Select the branch you want to deploy from
24. Next, click on **Enable Automatic Deploys** (#)
25. In **Manual Deploy** section, click on **Deploy Branch**
25. Upon completion, you will receive a confirmation message saying *“your app was successfully deployed”*
26. Finally, in the top right corner of the screen, click on **Open App** to view the application

> (#) Activate this option to automatically rebuild the app when a new *git commit* is pushed.
